__My Chosen Terms__


__Term/Concept 1__: Interface 

__Definition__: An interface is a facilitator for different parties to communicate effectively. They include computers communicating with each other, a user with the computer and a user with any type of mechanism.

__My Understanding (Rate 1-5):__ 4.5 

__Example/Application:__ An example for this concept is the television remote control. It provides the communication line between user and television. The mechanisms inside the remote control instruct the television on what to do based on what the user selects.


__Term/Concept 2:__ Client-Server model

__Definition:__ The client is the one who has a need to use software for whatever reason and they are responsible for giving the server instructions on what to look for and bring back. The server processes the request and sends back relevant information to the client.

__My Understanding (Rate 1-5)__: 4

__Example/Application__: An instance where this takes place is when a user searches the web. They are a client who is in need of information or they desire to share some information so they approach a server (which stores the information) through an API and the server sends back information or grants permission to post.


__Term/Concept 3__: API Components

__Definition__: Since an API facilitates the communication between software services, their components facilitate exactly how that process happens. They are the conditions, language and terms that the systems and services use to communicate.

__My Understanding (Rate 1-5)__: 4

__Example/Application__: One component is communicating errors effectively and consistently through all types of software services. For instance the 404 error message that appears when the user requests something that does not exist from the server or error 400 when the URL is incorrect.



__Term/Concept 4__: API Exploration and Implementation

__Definition__: This is the process where a programmer takes the time to investigate an API that they wish to integrate into their program, they do research on exactly what it is, what it does and then how to integrate it. Once they are satisfied with how it works, they incorporate it, test if it works and then maintain it regularly.

__My Understanding (Rate 1-5)__: 5

__Example/Application__: When one wishes to add music streaming to their gym app, they can incorporate the spotify API that has access to all types of music that exist in the world. They would then have to go through all those steps to ensure functionality.


__Term/Concept 5:__ Helper Libraries

__Definition__: They are packages that include everything needed to make the specific API functional. They essentially contain all information and qualities that are necessary to make an API easier and more beneficial to use.

__My Understanding (Rate 1-5)__: 3

__Example/Application:__ They are applied in situations when one decides to incorporate an API into their program, they could just copy and paste the API and it will work but the package is better in that it comes equipped with authentications, more effective error handling and community support.
